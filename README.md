# Welcome to My Hub! üëã                                                                                                                

I'm a **Business & Data Analyst** who's expertise lies in transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights. I focus on building robust systems and reports that drive strategic decision-making and business optimization.


## What keeps me busy?

**Predictive Modelling**: I thrive on creating new correlation rules and constructing sophisticated forecasting models (in Excel, Python, and R) to enable accurate business predictions.

**_Analyzing & optimizing_**: I specialize in Business Process Analysis (BPA), using As-Is/To-Be models to streamline workflows and reduce processing times. I particularly enjoy identifying data errors and standardizing datasets for improved reliability.

**_Creating BI Dashboards_**: I create unified, executive-level reports and dashboards (Power BI, Tableau) that consolidate disparate data sources, saving senior leadership significant time on manual data aggregation.

## Fun facts about me

* I have a habit of obsessing over the tiniest details in my code.
* I can lose track of time when I‚Äôm debugging (the best way to time travel, if you ask me).
* I believe every problem has a solution; you just have to keep at it long enough to find it.
